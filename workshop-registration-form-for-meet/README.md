<p>This code creates a landing page for an "Analytics 101" workshop registration.</p>

<h3>Files:</h3>

<h4>index.html:</h4> <p>The main HTML file for the website.</p>
<h4>style.css:</h4> <p>The CSS file that styles the website.</p>
<h3>Features:</h3>

<h4>Workshop Information:</h4> <p>Displays the workshop title, a brief description, and the host information (name and title).</p>
<h4>Registration Form:</h4> <date.>Allows users to register for the workshop by entering their first name, last name, email, and selecting a date.</p>
<h3>Styling:</h3>

<p>The website uses a split-screen layout with a blue background on the left and a white background on the right. The form section includes placeholders and labels for better user experience.</p>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<p>The form currently does not submit information anywhere. It would require additional programming (e.g., with Javascript) to process registrations.</p>

<p>Implement functionality for the form to submit registration data (e.g., send an email or store data in a database).</p>
<p>Add validation to the form to ensure users enter required information correctly.</p>
<p>Include a confirmation message after successful registration.</p>

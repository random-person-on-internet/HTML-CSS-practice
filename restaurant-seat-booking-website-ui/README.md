# restaurant-seat-booking-website

This is a basic website for a restaurant with a seat booking form. <br>

<h3>Files:</h3>

index.html: The main HTML file for the website. <br>
style.css: The CSS file that styles the website. <br>
<h3>Features:</h3>

Restaurant information with a short description and contact details (email and phone number). <br>
A simple booking form to reserve a table. Users can enter their name, email, desired date, and the number of people (currently not functional). <br>
<h3>Running the Website:</h3>

Save the index.html and style.css files in the same directory. <br>
Open index.html in a web browser to view the website. <br>
<h3>Note:</h3>

The booking form currently does not submit information anywhere. It would require additional programming (e.g., with Javascript) to send reservation requests. <br>
The "Person" dropdown in the form is not functional yet. It would need to be populated with options for the number of people. <br>

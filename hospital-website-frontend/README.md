<h2>This is a basic website layout for a hospital with the following functionalities:</h2>

<h3>Contact Information:</h3> <p>Displays hospital address, operation hours, and phone number.</p>
<h3>Navigation Menu:</h3> <p>Links to various sections of the website (currently not functional).</p>
<h3>Main Content Area:</h3>
<h4>Left Section:</h4> <p>Displays a motivational quote, doctor count, medical staff count, and total patient count.</p>
<h4>Right Section:</h4> <p>Showcases an image (replace "img.webp" with your desired image file name).</p>
<h2>Files:</h2>

<h3>index.html:</h3> <p>The main HTML file for the website.</p>
<h3>style.css:</h3> <p>The CSS file that styles the website.</p>
<h2>Styling:</h2>

<p>The website uses flexbox for layout and incorporates a blue color scheme.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<p>The navigation menu links are not currently functional and would require additional coding (e.g., linking to separate HTML files).</p>
<p>You'll need to replace "img.webp" in the code with the filename of your desired image.</p>
<h2>Further Development:</h2>

<p>Implement functionality for the navigation menu to link to different website sections.</p>
<p>Add content sections for "About Us", "Services", and other relevant information.</p>
<p>Include a contact form for user inquiries.</p>
<p>Make the website responsive to display well on different screen sizes.</p>
<p>This is a starting point for a hospital website. You can customize and expand upon this code to create a more comprehensive and informative website.</p>
